#Twitter Front End
##Makers Academy Week 7 Test


###Aim

The aim of this test was to reimplement the Twitter.com feed page as close as possible to the real look and feel. It was important to spend time inspecting the structure of the Twitter code before diving into this task.

This test was purely focused on the front-end, and as such there was no requirement for any back-end files or tests. We were only required to produce HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

###Other details

The task was set by Alex Peattie, [@alexpeattie](http://www.github.com/alexpeattie)

###Goals
* Reproduce the Twitter header
* Reproduce a page full of tweets
* Add JavaScript to implement infinite scrolling
* Expand the tweet input box on focus
* Develop the popup to add a new tweet
* Make the site responsive

###To do

I only managed to reproduce the Twitter header in the time I had available to attempt this task. I also managed to put in placeholders for the side boxes, and news feed.

I will eventually return to this task in order to complete it, populating the new feed and fulfilling the other required goals.
